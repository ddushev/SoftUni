            <p>The Star Wars API is the world's first quantified and programmatically-formatted set of Star Wars data.</p>
            <p>After hours of watching films and trawling through content online, we present to you all the People, Films, Species, Starships, Vehicles and Planets from Star Wars.</p>
            <p>We've formatted this data in JSON and exposed it to you in a RESTish implementation that allows you to programmatically collect and measure the data.</p>
            <p>Check out the documentation to get started consuming swapi data</p>
